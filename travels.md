## My favorite vacation:

My favorite vacation has to be to Hawaii. I was brought along with my partners family during the week of Thanksgiving 2012. It was amazing! I had never been before and getting to experience it with my love was perfect. We had a luau bbq for Thanksgiving dinner(*which had me rethinking the whole turkey thing*), watched the sunsets from the beach, and swimming in the ocean. Since it was Thanksgiving too it wasn't particularly crowded. It's been almost a decade, but I can still taste the drinks from the hotel bar, and still see my partner smiling in front of the ocean.
