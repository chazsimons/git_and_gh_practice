## A new career!

*I've been afraid of making this move for a long time. I've worked in the same job, doing the same thing, for 14 years. I love it, but it's retail. It's super customer facing, and they can be very particular. Comic collecting can bring that out in a person. I've made so many friends and have helped the shop I work at grow from 1 location to 3! So leaving the security I have at this job has been a scary thought.*

## So why the change?

**Honestly there's a few reasons.**
  1. Pay. It sounds shallow, but I've topped out what I can make at this job.
  2. The chance to invest in myself and learn a new skill.
  3. I love collaborating with others, so a field that's strong in collaboration sounds great!
  4. It's time for the change. The last few years sort of blend into each other because almost every day is the same. I'm excited and motivate to learn and face new challenges daily.
